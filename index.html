    <h2>About Us</h2>
    Aiónia Epochí is a Not For Profit effort from people around the world to help make this world a more peaceful place for humanity. 
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    The world at present is increasingly becoming hostile to the survival of the human race. The modern world has many new problems of its own. Climate change, illiteracy and misinformation appear to be the leading issues pushing the world inch-by-inch towards a state of increasing instability. But, the modern world also comes with many advantages from the technological advancement, a better understanding of the universe among others. 
	  Our mission is to use the new tools of technology and artificial intelligence to find solutions to the burning global issues. With this we aim to make this world a better place with the tools we have.  We also aim to push the boundaries of science by doing research on  the best possible ways to solve the problems at hand. We also aim to motivate and inspire the young generation and the curious minds to help us make this world a better place for us all.
    In a nutshell, our aim is to inspire change, ignite the minds and motivate humanity towards a better future. We strive to light the torch of hope in the minds of all, and keep it lit for all times to come!
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    We started out in 2019 with a single project called the DNA (or Densifying Nature Appreciation initially called the Steem Biodiversity Portal). It was a project aimed at working on cataloguing the global biodiversity using crowd-sourced data. We realised that this project couldn't work well in isolation, and hence we started parallel inter-dependent projects which can grow together and help us walk towards our goals.
